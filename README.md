# Show Scorer

## Overview
This Python tool scrapes episode ratings for TV shows from IMDB (in compliance with their robots.txt) using either a query or an IMDB ID. It then visualizes the data in two ways:
- **Heatmap**: Displays season-wise episode ratings.
- **Lineplot**: Shows trends in ratings over the series duration.
- **Statistics**: Includes interesting statistics as the highest and lowest rated episodes, sharpest decline or incline between episodes and seasons averages, entire show rating average, and more.
